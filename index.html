<h3><i>"Computers are stupid"</i></h3>
<p>You will hear people say "computer are stupid" because they follow instrustions to the t. Even when those instructions are flawed.

<p> A bunch of computers that communicate with each other by sending an HTTP request to a server. When a person goes to a web page like <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, the server finds said HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer, web browsers like safari, google chrome, or mozila foxfire display the html document that we recognize as web pages.</p><br>
